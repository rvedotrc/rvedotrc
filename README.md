## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Over the last 20 years or so almost all of my work has been for my employers, and is therefore private. But hey, look at [BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/) or [Zendesk Guide](https://zendesk.com/guide) to get an idea of what I was making.

## Other stuff

As well as this GitHub account, you can also some of my stuff:

- on my org account, [@blaahaj](https://github.com/blaahaj/)
- on my blog, [Typing with mittens on](https://rachelevans.org/blog/)

## Currently working on

Tech things that I'm currently working on include:

- Labelling the photos in my archive (93000 and counting) â€” they're currently only indexed by date
- (Selectively) publishing those photographs, probably under a Creative Commons license

(as of January 2025)

## Links to random stuff that I've made

- [Hexagonal Distractions](https://blaahaj.github.io/hexagons/) â€“ web art using CSS animations
